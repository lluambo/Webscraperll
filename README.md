# Webscraperll
Simple web scraper to get data from a test blog. The scrapper gets the title of all the blogs posted, the date they were posted, and the link of each blog and prints it as well as appends it into a dictionary for later use on manipulation. You will need to have requests and Beautiful Soup 4 installed. Needs a few edits depending on the html on the website.
